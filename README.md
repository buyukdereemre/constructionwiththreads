Apartment Construction Simulation â€“ C with Fork and Threads

This project simulates the construction of a multi-story apartment building using the C programming language. Each floor is represented as a separate process (via fork), and each apartment (room) is modeled as a thread. Shared resources such as cranes, plumbing, and electrical systems are synchronized using semaphores. The project demonstrates key concepts of multi-threading, multi-processing, and synchronization in operating systems.
